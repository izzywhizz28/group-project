      <h2>Layout</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
          The index page should be at the very start of your Bullet Journal.
          The purpose of the index page is to act like a contents page, detailing
          where to find everything in your journal so when you want to add something
          to a list or fill in you're weeks page you know where to look!
        </li>
        <p>
          Your index page can also include a key, if you decide to use one, for
          your trackers or lists to symbolise what the tasks mean i.e. important,
          complete, etc...
        </p>
        <li>
          Overview pages are a great way of looking at the future in a glance.
        </li>
        <p>
          You should include an overview page at the start of each month to
          easily see key events happening soon such as birthdays, meetings or
          holidays.
        </p>
        <li>
          Migration pages are a way of carrying over leftover tasks from the
          previous week or month.
        </li>
        <p>
          They're a useful tool as it saves you having to rewrite out the same
          info at a later date as you can push the task forward and easily see
          what you still need to complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should include one at the end of each month, and depending on how
          busy you're schedule is, one at the end of each week.
        </p>
        <li>
          Log pages are simply the layout of a typical diary, you can have
          ones with a spread of the year, the month or the week.
        </li>
        <p>
          Ideally, if you are going to include a spread page of the year e.g
          a calendar of the year, you should place this near the start of your
          journal.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can include extra detail to your log pages such as what the weather
          was like on each day or small trackers.
        </p>
        <li>
          Tracker pages and collection pages should both be places towards the
          end of your journal, so as to not be in the way of you're logs and so
          more pages can be added in the future if needed and they'll all be
          found in the same location.
        </li>
        <p>
          Tracker pages and collections are essentially ways of improving your
          health and keeping note of things you want to do in the future.
