    Not sure where to start with everything? Don't panic! We've got you sorted.
    From how to layout your Bullet Journal to what stationery you need, you'll
    find everything you need to know here!
    <br>
    So, what will I need to make my bullet journal?
    As noted earlier, you really dont need much to get started with a bullet
    journal, but if you want to snazz it up a bit then try out some of these:
    <ul>
      <li>Style your page with drawings related to the theme. For example, if
        you went with the idea of having a reading list then design the page
        like a library with the books on the shelf the books on your list and
        shade each one in as you've read them.</li>
      <li>If the above seems like too much, then why not try adding a small
        drawing or doodle to the page by the title. For example, following on
        with the reading list idea you could draw a book with a set of glasses
        on top next to the title. It's a small detail but it adds more
        character to the page!</li>
      <li>Write the titles of your pages in fancy fonts, or try a different
        font for every title!</li>
    </ul>


    Not very artistic? No problem! We have things to help you out too!
    <ul>
      <li>Use stencils to help you get fancy borders and outlines to your
        pages. Stencils can also be used to write in different fonts which you
        can use to write the titles of your pages.</li>
      <li>Add some stickers! This is a quick and easy fix if you're no
        good at drawing but want to add detail to the page!</li>
      <li>Get creative with Washi tape! Washi tape can be used as a border,
        to separate different parts of your page, as a fancy underline, the
        limits are endless! Many stores sell this and you can get all sorts of
        patterns and colours.</li>
    </ul>
