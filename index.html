    <h3>What <em>is</em> a Bullet Journal?</h3>
    <p>
    Fundamentally, a bullet journal is a customisable diary. You make it as
    stylish and colourful and include whatever you like. Find out more about
    bullet journals <a href="about/about.html">here!</a>

    <h3>What do I need to make a Bullet Journal?</h3>
    <p>
    Not much! To make your own Bullet Journal all you need is:
    <ul>
      <li>An unused notebook (blank, dotted or squared)</li>
      <li>A pen</li>
      <li>A ruler</li>
      <li>Some crayons (felts work too!)</li>
      <li>You!</li>
    </ul>
    Of course, there are more things you can use than that, which you can find
    more on <a href="tips/organise.html">here</a>, but the essential items are listed
    above.
