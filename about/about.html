    <h2>Where did the idea come from?</h2>
    <p>
      The Idea of Bullet Journals came from Ryder Carroll, who designed it
      as a way of helping him keep on track and remember things. He was diagnosed
      with learning difficulties as a child, and so needed different approaches
      towards life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end result was the Bullet Journal.
    <br>
    <h2>What is a Bullet Journal?</h2>
    <p>
      A Bullet Journal is a fancy diary, you can add in what you like and include
      lists, collections, trackers, all sorts of things to help you along with life
      besides a basic calendar an ordinary diary provides.
      <blockquote>
        <q>Essentially, the bullet journal is a framework for capturing your
        ideas. It allows you to keep track of what's happened to you and allows you
        to organise what is currently going on and plan for the future</q> - Ryder Carroll.
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <h2>Why should i use one?</h2>
    <p>
      In this age, social media is everywhere and our lives are more hectic and
      stressful than ever. Bullet Journals give you that step back into calm and
      allow you to focus your thoughts, track your health and your life and allow
      down time from the technological world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colouring books for adults are popping up all over the markets, and with
      a bullet journal you can take advantage of this. You can add drawings
      or make colouring pages in your journal as a way of destressing.
